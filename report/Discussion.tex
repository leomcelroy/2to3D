\section{Discussion}

This section should begin with a brief summary of your results. Next, provide a
more detailed synopsis of your results: What new knowledge do they offer? What
lessons did you learn? What is the main take-away message of your work?
Finally, you should provide a brief critique of your own work: Point out the
specific attributes that you feel are extremely positive and note any
weaknesses or limitations. Discuss how your project could be improved. You can
also discuss possible extensions of your work. This section should be
approximately 1 page in length.
