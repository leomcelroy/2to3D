\section{Methods}

This section should include the following:

\begin{itemize}
		
\item	A description of the methods you are using (which itself could have
	sub-sections). If you have created a new application, you should describe
	which tools you have used to do so and the steps of your implementation. You
	should also briefly describe each of the tools you used (e.g. Ruby on Rails,
	MongoDB, D3, etc.). If you have proposed a new algorithm to solve a problem,
	you should provide the details of your algorithm along with pseudocode. If
	your algorithm is quite complex, you should describe its running time.  

\item Description of any data you used and explanation of why you chose this
	particular data (possibly organized into sub-sections).

\item Link to a GitHub, BitBucket or other repository if relevant.

\end{itemize}
