\section{Problem Statement}

Formally describe the problem you are solving/studying. Provide the details of
the problem, and any background that is necessary for a reader to understand
the problem, methods, and results. This is where you may want to articulate any
assumptions your research makes, and provide any important definitions. This is
also a good section to provide any explanatory figures that illustrate your
problem. This section should be approximately 1-2 pages in length.
