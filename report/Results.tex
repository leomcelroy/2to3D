\section{Results}

%This section should include the following:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%	
%	\item Details and explanations of results obtained (which itself could have
%		sub-sections). This is where you should provide tables, graphs, and/or
%		figures that illustrate your results. If you have created a new
%		application, include screenshots of it in action. You should also provide a
%		link to your application if it is web-based.
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%You should entitle these sections and sub-sections with names that describe the
%key points (for example, instead of ``methods we use", the heading
%``Statistical-Based Learning" would be more informative). The Methods and
%Results sections should together be approximately 3-4 pages in length.
