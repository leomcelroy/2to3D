\section{Results}

This section should include the following:

\begin{itemize}

	
	\item Details and explanations of results obtained (which itself could have
		sub-sections). This is where you should provide tables, graphs, and/or
		figures that illustrate your results. If you have created a new
		application, include screenshots of it in action. You should also provide a
		link to your application if it is web-based.

\end{itemize}

You should entitle these sections and sub-sections with names that describe the
key points (for example, instead of ``methods we use", the heading
``Statistical-Based Learning" would be more informative). The Methods and
Results sections should together be approximately 3-4 pages in length.
